			Our project was a culmination of a quarter long group project in User Interface 
			Design at the University of Washington in Fall 2014.  
			This website documents our journey as we define, ideate, research, design, and prototype our solutions.

			<h2>Problem Description</h2>
			<p class="psec" >As fossil fuels wane and our society demands more efficient and effective means of transportation, electric cars will fill that void. Current energy management systems for these cars are ineffective and do not promote trust between car and user. Our team is trying to solve this problem by creating a sleek, new interface that manages energy usage more efficiently and is easy to use. The goal is to make the car more reliable and provide a seamless transition from driving the cars of the past to those of the future. </p>
			<h2>Target Users</h2>
			<p class="psec" >Our product is specifically designed for electric powered cars. This means that the design is specialized for consumers who currently own an electric car or are likely to purchase one in the future. The demographic range has a wide variety of traits that must be considered. According to the Electric Vehicle Information Exchange (EVIX) the median income for owners of electric vehicles is $108, 624.00, about double the national median household. Further statistics show that 77 percent of electric car owners hold a four-year degree, 79 percent are male, and the average age is 46 years old. It is clear that the typical consumer we are designing for are aware of the energy crisis the planet is going through and are knowledgeable enough to consider electric cars. Also, we would likely target middle-aged consumers who have a steady enough income to purchase an electric vehicle.</p>
			
			<h2>Research findings</h2>
				<p class="psec" >Over the last 15 years there has been an increase in research for managing power in vehicles. One such study from IEEE Control Systems Society states that simulations for energy management concepts are working. The most promising avenue to pursue in this area is regenerative braking that will provide charging to the battery every time the brakes are applied. That being said, the vast majority of research done for electric cars is centered on manufacturing more reliable and efficient cars and gauging consumer interest in the product. Engineers and companies need to make sure their products work before they can focus on managing the power usage. </p>

			<h2>Persona</h2>
			<p class="psec" >The persona we created to fit the ideal candidate for our product is Drew â€˜Danger' Driver. Drew is a 31 year old male who can be described as funny, quirky, socially insecure, a good public speaker, and has commitment issues.  His hobbies include: going to happy hour with coworkers, attending board game nights, and brewing with his old man. He also loves sports and is a season ticket holder for the Seattle Seahawks. He is currently the VP of sporting goods at Amazon where he makes 150,000 dollars annually. Much of his job consists of him driving around to sporting goods warehouses to get status updates, meet with clients, and check on inventory. Like many electric car owners he hates paying for gas but is hesitant to switch to electric cars because he lacks confidence in the power ability.</p>

			<h2>Design Criteria</h2>
			<p class="psec" >When designing the final prototype of our product and system, we had four priorities in mind. These priorities were determined from our research into similar products and the electric car user profiles, and from testing of our initial prototype. The priorities are:

<ul><li class="psec"><b>The user has to be able to use our product safely while driving. </b>
This means large target areas for buttons and slide out menus as well 
as large text on screen and zero clutter. Additionally, the product responds 
to voice commands and has an integrated digital personal assistant to 
assist the user with hands free actions.</li>
<li class="psec"><b>The system prioritizes the user getting home to charge over stopping 
at a charging station. </b>We created smart recommendations that notify the user 
when they need to change to a more energy efficient power mode and when 
they need to navigate home to charge. Additionally, the system looks at 
energy usage metrics and will make recommendations on length of charging time.</li>
<li class="psec"><b>Information on battery health should be transparent to ease user worries. </b>
We included a panel that the user can access from any screen. The panel 
has data on the car's health and performance so users can make informed decisions about their driving itinerary.</li>
<li class="psec"><b>Energy management is heavily dependent on where the user is driving.</b> Thus a live updating map and the ability to route a trip are front and center on the interface. </li></ul>
 </p>
			
			<h2>IA &amp Wireframes</h2>
			<p class="psec" > The original design for our product was complex and feature heavy. Our intent was to give the user control over all 
			systems in the car that used battery power and give the user the ability to plan complex driving itineraries. Users found 
			this system too cluttered and did not take well to the design. We went back to our system map and narrowed down 
			our features list to help us design for a less complex system. </p>

			<h2>Final Mock-up</h2>
			<p class="psec" >Our final product is a touch screen interface and custom wheel that would come pre-installed in a fictional electric car called the Phoenix ChargEd. We decided to put it in a fictional car to better envision an entire system that was built to be harmonious with our product.  
			</br>The core functionality of our design is to help users make informed decisions on managing their car's battery power. 
			This is achieved through popup alert smart recommendations prompting the user on actions they should take to maintain 
			sufficient charge, a details panel of car and battery metrics, and a menu of energy modes users could choose from. </p>
